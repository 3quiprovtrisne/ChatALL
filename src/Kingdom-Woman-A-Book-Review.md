The book is divided into three sections: The Significance of a Kingdom Woman, The Foundation of a Kingdom Woman, and The Fruit of a Kingdom Woman. In each section, the authors share biblical insights, personal stories, and practical applications to help women discover and embrace their identity and calling as kingdom women.
 
A kingdom woman, according to the authors, is a woman who "positions herself under and operates according to the rule of God over every area of her life." She is not defined by her circumstances, her culture, or her critics, but by her relationship with God. She is not perfect, but she is passionate about pursuing God and His Word. She is not afraid to exercise her authority in Christ, but she does so with humility and grace. She is not limited by her challenges, but she sees them as opportunities to grow and glorify God.
 
The book is full of biblical examples of kingdom women, such as Sarah, Ruth, Esther, Mary, Priscilla, and more. The authors also share their own experiences and struggles as a father-daughter duo who have learned to live as kingdom men and women in their own families and ministries. They offer honest and encouraging advice on topics such as marriage, singleness, parenting, career, ministry, finances, health, and more.
 
The book is not only informative, but also inspirational. It challenges women to rise above the mediocrity and complacency that the world offers and to pursue the excellence and destiny that God has for them. It reminds women that they are not alone in their journey, but they have a heavenly Father who loves them unconditionally and a kingdom family who supports them faithfully. It invites women to join a movement of kingdom women who are making a difference in their homes, communities, and nations for the glory of God.

One of the key themes of the book is the importance of faith. The authors emphasize that a kingdom woman must trust God and His promises, even when she does not understand His ways or see His hand. She must walk by faith, not by sight, and rely on God's power, not her own. She must also have faith in herself, knowing that God has created her with a unique purpose and gifted her with a unique potential. She must not let fear, doubt, or insecurity hold her back from fulfilling her destiny.
 
Another key theme of the book is the value of relationships. The authors stress that a kingdom woman must cultivate healthy and godly relationships with God, herself, and others. She must love God with all her heart, soul, mind, and strength, and seek to please Him above all else. She must love herself as God loves her, and accept herself as God made her. She must also love others as God loves them, and serve them as God leads her. She must honor her husband if she is married, respect her parents if she is single, nurture her children if she is a mother, and support her friends if she is a sister.
 
A third key theme of the book is the impact of legacy. The authors point out that a kingdom woman must live with an eternal perspective, knowing that her life has a ripple effect on generations to come. She must be intentional about passing on her faith, values, and wisdom to her children and grandchildren. She must also be influential in her sphere of influence, whether it is at home, at work, at church, or in the community. She must use her gifts and talents to bless others and advance God's kingdom. She must leave a legacy that honors God and inspires others.
